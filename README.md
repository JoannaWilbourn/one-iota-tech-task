# OneIotaTechTask

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Design & development

I treated this exercise as though it were an initial prototype/mock-up for use in requirements gathering. As such, I focused on implementing basic functionality to meet the requirements as stated.

The recently viewed items and shopping cart do not persist outside the current session - this obviously wouldn't be appropriate for a production environment, and would be an area I would look to develop further with more time.

Other areas I might revisist would be allowing the shopping cart to be edited - changing sizes, amounts etc. I would also like to enhance the product page with things like image zoom, record navigation, or adding multiple items to basket at once.

I have used [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) to generate a consistent look and feel. With more time I would like to explore creating my own components.
